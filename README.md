# highpoint-pf2e-toolkit
Highpoint Dungeon Crawl Toolkit for Foundry VTT Pathfinder 2E module
This is a module made for sharing rolltables and assets for the discord server High-Point: PF2E Crawl. 

Intended instructions for use, but really do whatever with what is provided: 
1. Setup a scene from an included map from the compendium, or from your favorite random map generator. 
2. Use the included macro to generate random creatures based on level and difficulty of encounter. Drag the creatures onto the scene and find you best token for each of them. (no token images included due to copy rights on art work).
3. Roll for hazards for the doors in the room or randomly placed hazards in hallways. 
4. Run the dungeon with a party of awesome adventurers. 
5. Use random loot tables to reward those awesome adventurers for defeating each room in the dungeon. 


Changelog: 
v0.0.1 - initial testing of rolltables referencing rolltables within module and try out of including maps in module with reference to images in module. 
v0.0.2 - Initial draft of a random encounter generator based on the created rolltables for the module. Added a few more creature tables for plants.
